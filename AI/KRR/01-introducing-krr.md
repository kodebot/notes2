# 1. Introducing KRR

## 1.1. What is it?

* KRR - Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

* KRR - concerns
  * representation of knowledge in a form suitable for computational manipulation and exchange
  * together with the use of reasoning to process knowledge represented in this way to both
    * generate new knowledge and
    * uncover properties of existing knowledge

## 1.2 Main concepts

### What is inference or reasoning?

* Reasoning is computation with symbols representing statements, rather than with numerals

* Inputs are combined with the rules of a process (operator in numerical terms) to produce output

  * numerical 2, 4 $\rightsquigarrow$ 6 (process=add)
  * reasoning `if it is a bank holiday then the weather is bad` (P $\rightarrow$ Q), `it is a bank holiday` ($P$) $\rightsquigarrow$ `so the weather is bad`
  * the above can expressed just using symbols as well $P \rightarrow Q$, $P$ $\rightsquigarrow Q$
